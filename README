CONTENTS

gsl based random variable sampling for gnucap. implemented as "functions". see
ngspice manual for function and argument names.

USAGE

attach f_random.so using -a or the load/attach command. then "random functions"
are available.

BUILD

this requires "gnucap-conf". available in gnucap unstable.  type

$ make
$ make install


to build for other flavors, e.g. gnucap-uf, type

$ make SUFFIX=-uf

TODO

- random-seed management not implemented
- complete a few corner cases
- testing

LIMITATIONS

this is not fully compatible to ngspice (according to the manual), which is due
to limitations in ngspice expression handling.

command                gnucap (in spice mode)      ngspice
.param x=gauss(1,1)    declare random variable     pick random sample
.eval x                pick random sample          ?
.measure xs=eval(x)    assign random sample        ?

BUGS

for sure. please report.
